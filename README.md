# Light Novel OCR

Program to extract text from untranslated/Japanese Light Novel images using Tesseract and OpenCV.

## Inspiration
I'm a huge Light Novel fan, and sometimes I see get untranslated novel PDFs or images which cannot be copy/pasted to translate. Google Lens also cannot translate these files for some odd reason. So I ended up making this piece of software to convert those images to text format, and then just paste that into DeepL or Google Translate to spend my entire afternoon reading.
